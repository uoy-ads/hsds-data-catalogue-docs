Five filters are available based on the metadata supplied for each resource: All fields \u2013 searches the entire record for matching terms.Time period \u2013 searches for time period(s) names.Place \u2013 searches for place names, from specific locations to continents.Title \u2013 searches only within the title fields for matching terms.Getty AAT Subject \u2013 searches subject(s) defined by the data provider that are matched to the Getty Arts and Architecture Thesaurus, enabling you to find data with matching translations and related terms. <p>Enter one or more keywords in the text search box. When you use multiple words, the search will only find results that include every word you've entered. This is referred to as \"AND\" logic in search terminology. For example, a search for climate change\u201d will return only records where both these words are found in the metadata, either next to one another or separately. </p> <p>When you enter a search term, a list of up to 10 matching records are displayed based on where the term appears in the metadata.

For example, if you select Title and search for the term 'Historic Building', the catalogue will return all records containing the text \u201cHistoric Building\u201d in the Title field.</p> <p>The Getty AAT Subject is a hierarchical search, which means any broad term such as \u201chouses\u201d will also include all results from sub-categories, such as Hall houses, Farmhouses, and Manor houses.

These appear as \u2018heat spots\u2019 on the map interface. You can zoom in and out to a limited extent and change the map layers using the icons provided. See \"Map filter options\" below for more information. By default, zooming in and out options will not change the defined area or the search results. Use the map search feature to narrow down your results by location. When you zoom in on the map, a \"Search area\" button will appear at the top. Click this button to update the search results list to show only the resources visible in your current map view.As you zoom in closer, or when there are 500 resources or less, the heat map changes to show clusters and pins for more precise resource locations.
