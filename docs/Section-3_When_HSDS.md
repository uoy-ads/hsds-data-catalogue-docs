# When - The Time period tool

The When tool consists of two different ways of selecting a time period of interest: a graphic where you can use the mouse to select the date range and a text entry box where you can specify start and end years.

## The Time line


| The Time line | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![Time line graphic](../assets/HSDS_Time-line1.png) | The Time line graphic displays the number of resources returned in your search results by date distribution.<p><p>You can refine the search results by clicking ‘Advanced Search’ to display the Time period filter page (see below). <p>If no search term is used then the graph shows the date distribution for the entire catalogue. |
| ![Time line with a selected period](../assets/HSDS_Time-line2.png) | On the 'Browse when' page, you can define a shorter time period by using the mouse and the Shift key directly on the display - in this case -200-1400 C.E.<p><p>Scrolling with your mouse will cause the time period graphic to expand. <p>If you place the mouse closer to the left side, the x-axis will reduce the end date (‘stretch’ from the left), placed to the right the start date increases (‘stretch’ from the right).|
| ![Time line expanded over selected period](../assets/HSDS_Time-line3.png) | Whenever you alter the time line graphic, the range updates to show your selected time span, and the distribution of resources by date is recalculated.<p><p>Clicking ‘Display as search result’ returns to the Results page displaying the refined records. |

## Filter by Year 

An alternative method for selecting a time period is to enter the start and end years in the text box below the graph. For dates before 0, place a - symbol before the number.

Using either method (graph or direct year entry), all records that specify a time period falling within or overlapping your selected time period will be returned in the results – as shown in the illustration below.
