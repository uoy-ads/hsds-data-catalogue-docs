# When - The Time period tool

The When tool consists of three different ways of selecting a time period of interest: a graphic where you can use the mouse to select the date range, a text entry box where you can specify start and end years, and a separate filter that uses named time periods as defined in [PeriodO](https://perio.do/en/).

## The Time line


| The Time line | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![Time line graphic](../assets/13-Timeline-1.png) | The Time line graphic displays the number of resources returned in your search results by date distribution.<p><p>You can refine the search results by clicking ‘Advanced Search’ to display the Time period filter page (see below). <p>If no search term is used or the filter is accessed via the ‘Advanced Search’ option, then the graph shows the date distribution for the entire catalogue. |

## Filter by Year 

An alternative method for selecting a time period is to enter the start and end years in the text box below the graph. 

Using either method (graph or direct year entry), all records that specify a time period falling within or overlapping your selected time period will be returned in the results – as shown in the illustration below.

## Filter by Time Periods

This option enables filtering of the results by named time periods as defined in [PeriodO](https://perio.do/en/). There are two stages for this filter: Temporal region and Cultural period. The Cultural period can be used as a standalone filter or in combination with Temporal region.

Each box will display up to the first 20 periods. When more exist, you can view additional results by clicking the 'Get 20 more results' button at the bottom of the list. Alternatively, use the text input box above the list to search for specific periods. All matching options are shown as you type.
