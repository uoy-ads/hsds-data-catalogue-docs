# The Map (Where)

| Where | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![Map of search results displayed as heat spots](../assets/04-Map.png) | The map on the Search results page displays the location of the resources returned in the search results (where co-ordinates have been provided in the metadata). These are shown as ‘heat spots’ at the macro level, covering Europe and Japan in the example to the left (the initial global overview). <Br><Br>It is possible to zoom in and out (to a limited level) and to change the layers as indicated by the icons. See "Map filter options" below for more information about these.<Br><Br>By default, using the zoom in and out options will not change the defined area or the search results. |
| ![Map of search results with Search area option](../assets/55-Map_search_area.png) | This map can be used to refine the results as follows. After zooming in, a new option, “Search area”, will appear at the top of the map. Clicking on this will update both the (rectangular) search area to that currently shown by the map and the search results. In addition, once the search area becomes small enough and the number of resources is 500 or less, the heat map is replaced by clusters and pins to show the matching resource locations. Increasing the map area does not change the results again until the “Search area” option is used. <Br><Br>For more complicated search areas and greater geographical resolution, the map’s “Advanced search” option should be used. |

## Advanced search

Clicking on ‘Advanced Search’ will open the Map filter page where the search results can be refined geographically by selecting an area on the map.

![Map with display options](../assets/05-Full-map-with-filters.png)
<p align=center><i>Map filter page with full set of filters (left) geographical tools (right)</i></p>

The map can be used inter-changeably with the other filters which are displayed on the left side of the screen. They can be hidden by clicking on the yellow tab to the right of this column (Hide filters). 

The default view is a geographic Open Street Map (OSM) showing national borders. Note that native language place names are used on this map. 

## Map filter options

There are a number of options for use with the map filter, the icons for which are shown in a column in the bottom right hand corner. 

| Icon | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ![Layers icon for map display option](../assets/06-Layers-icon.png) | The Layers icon displays a sub-menu with six different options for the display of the map, four of which are from Google including a satellite and a street map version (granularity will depend on level of survey) and where English is used for all place names. |
| ![Zoom in and out icon for map display option](../assets/07-Zoom-icon.png) | The Zoom (in and out) icons for panning in and out of geographic regions. This can also be achieved with a touchpad (and mouse where enabled).|
| ![Set of drawing tool options - line. polygon and rectangle](../assets/08-Drawing-tool-icons.png) | The Drawing tools icons:<Br><Br>The Line tool will display the distance covered as each point is drawn. <p>The Polygon tool defines a multi-sided area on the map. <Br><Br>The Rectangle tool defines a rectangular area between two opposite corners. <p>The results are updated to show only the records located within the defined areas |

![Options for the drawimg tools](../assets/53-Edit_options_map.png)

Each of the drawing tools has options to complete or cancel the operation. 

### Display as search result
Once an area of interest has been defined, all the related resources can be displayed on the Results page by clicking on the ‘Display as search result’ part of the information box displayed in the top left corner of the screen

## Representation of resources on the map
### Pin icons

![Pin icons used on the map to denote resource locations](../assets/10-Map-pins.png)
<p><i>Pin icons used to represent individual resources on the Map</i></p>
  
Different modes are used to represent how resources are shown on the map. 
- A Geo point shows a single resource with exact co-ordinates. If there are more than one Geo point on the Map, then the one for the current resource is denoted by an inner red ring. 
- A Geo shape indicates a resource where the location is not precise. This may be due to the location being given as a geographical area (e.g. a town or region) for a resource or, for example, reports which cover large and/or multiple locations.
- Approx. location icons are shown where the location of the resource is considered to be sensitive, for example, ship wrecks or sites where valuable metal artefacts have been found. Blue ‘pins’ indicate an approximate point and red ‘pins’ an area. The individual record for red ‘pin’ sites will display a defined (often rectangular) area for the resource where the actual location will be a random point within the shown area.

| Icons | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ![Red pins used on map](../assets/11-Red-pins-on-map.png) | In this example, the red outline defines the area in which a gold finger ring was found and contains two other resources with nearby, imprecise locations. Other resources, both with exact and imprecise locations can also be seen within the larger area. |

### Cluster icons

![Cluster icons used to denote multiple icons at a map location](../assets/10a-Map-clusters.png)
<p><i>Cluster icons used to represent groups of resources on the Map</i></p>

Clusters are used to denote locations where multiple resources can be found. The different colours indicate the total number of resources, blue = 1-10, yellow = 11-99 and red 100+ resources.

![Multiple pins (expanded view) on the map](../assets/12-Multiple-pins.png) 

Mouseover can be used on each individual Geo point and Geo shape to display the title of the associated Resource. In this example, the circular pattern of Geo shapes refers to a cluster of resources which have all been allocated the same approximate location (i.e. the centroid point). This pattern is displayed when the cluster icon is clicked - each pin icon can be clicked on to go to the related resource record. 

Note that the Map functions in the same way in the Browse options as for the Results page, i.e. the same icons are used. There are some minor differences for the Map on the individual Resource page which are mainly to do with the display of an imprecise or approximate location for a resource (i.e. an area shown by a red boundary).
