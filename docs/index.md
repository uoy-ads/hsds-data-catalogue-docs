## About the Catalogue

Built on the robust infrastructure developed by the [ARIADNE RI](https://www.ariadne-research-infrastructure.eu/) for the [ARIADNE Portal](https://portal.ariadne-infrastructure.eu/), the HSDS Data catalogue is designed to suit a distinctive collection of scientific datasets, analytical reports, and research resources.

The Heritage Science Data Service provides core digital research services as part of the [RICHeS programme](https://www.riches.ukri.org/), the UK’s Research Infrastructure for Conservation and Heritage Science. For further information please visit the [HSDS Website](https://hsds.ac.uk/).

The HSDS Data Catalogue has been developed thanks to generous funding from UK Reserach and Innovation through AHRC’s RICHeS initiative.
