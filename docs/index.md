# Getting Started

The Heritage Science Data Service [**Data Catalogue**](https://hsds.ac.uk/data-catalogue/) is a comprehensive platform for discovering and accessing heritage science data and research resources from across the UK.

**What makes this catalogue unique?** With access to extensive heritage science resources, the catalogue addresses the challenge of discovering relevant materials by bringing together collections deposited with the Heritage Science Data Service and other providers into one searchable platform. Whether you're a conservation scientist, materials researcher, cultural heritage professional, or student, the HSDS Data Catalogue allows you to explore the UK's heritage science landscape through an intuitive interface..
